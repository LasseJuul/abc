            <p>
                Well, my name is Lasse Wæverstrøm Juul. I'm 23 years of age and currently living in Copenhagen, Denmark where i've lived for just over 2 years. I study Multimedia Design (MMD) at KEA and currently in my first year.

                Outside school i enjoy the basic stuff of a young Dane, sitting behind my computer and going out for beers. Even better if the beers are located on a slope in the Alpes as i enjoy travelling whenever i can and experiencing adrenaline pumping action.
