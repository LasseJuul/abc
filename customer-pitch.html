                Customer pitch</h1>
            <p>
                The customer pitch was the final project of this 1st semester of KEAs multimedia design education. We had to prepare a presentation to Foodsharing Copenhagen officials demonstrating our work.

            <p>
                We prepared for the presentation by using some tips such as keeping it short, precise and realistic. We also spend time rehearsing the pitch, talking out loud to try and perfect and remember our individual speaches. The last part is crutial, but it's still important to keep it lose and not have every word prepared.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                I've learned to be realistic when presenting a project. If presenting a product to a client it's crucial to be transparent with the work and workprocess. Also relaxing and preparing beforehand can be a big help, it's okay to be nervous but you should have confidence in your work, this will almost always also reward in a better outcome atleast for me personally.
