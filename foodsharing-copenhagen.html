            <p>
                Foodsharing Copenhagen was a project very relevant for getting experience of what projects you might find after graduation. We created a campaign site adressing one of their issues with spreading more information about foodwaste and included a video for educational use.

                In the project i was part of doing the storyboard for it, researching and helping coding of the website. We had been given permission to use Foodsharing Copenhagens name for this so there was no need to get copyrights. The idea behind the entire project was to spread awareness of foodwaste by comparing it to water waste and Co2 emission as they're working in Denmark the target audience was danes and more specific couples or smaller families.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                This amazing opportunity gave me a glimse of how working out in the "real life" is. It was hugely benefitial for the efforts that were needed to put into this. Most dominent was the video editing skills i learned and principles that I'd use such as rule of third, backlight and highlight, narration and sound effects. For the sound effects I researched the internet for copyright free music. In editing the video I worked together with another group member with past experience in Premiere Pro, that let me fiddle around and ask questions along the way. Most challenging was getting the timing right, the amount of time I needed to change clips by even 0.2 seconds.

            <p>
                We were also to make smaller videos suitable for social media and I had to reflect on what draws the attention when im scrolling around myself. We had a lot of group work that also helped improve my social skills. Also the acting skills were enhanced, even thought it wasn't a part of the curriculum.

            <p>
                In addition, the content made for the website had to be in sync with the company, their guidelines and image they want to send. So the content was carefully produced to comply with these and it felt like I was working for them, making me be even more selective and meticulous.
