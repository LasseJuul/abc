            <p>
                The onboarding project convered every aspect of multimedia development. It had group work, design development, storytelling, usability, interactivity, coding and finally presentation. My group and I developed a game about moving to Denmark with gamification as a new tool. This was all presented at an exhibition stand.

                My part in this project was mainly character development, style tile, helping with coding and presentation. We choose our game to be about the "Danish Experience", meaning that for non-danes they'd get an insight into what Denmark is all about. This also required some research which i helped with being the only Dane in the group.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                I got to improve on some already aquired skills such as character development, style tile, "think aloud test" and group work. The character was developed from the bottom using illustrator, I made the mistake of diving straight into illustrator with just an idea and it turned out a bit disappointing. The character didn't feel unique and just plain boring, it would properly have been better to draw some sketches and go on from there. Also i got better at creating the sprite animation, useing our character on the bike pedelling.

            <p>
                The think aloud test was a great way of getting new input towards what to change in our game. It gave insights towards what was clear for the user and what needed to be reworked. Taught me how to value the input of a second eye. Furthermore we had some issues when uploading the code, i ended up debugging the code which was largely a group members work. It really set it into perspective how important comments in ones code are for others to read.

                The exhibition stand was fairly simple made to keep focus on the game with some common elemnts such as a point system and a tracker to help the user visuallize where in the game they are. The exhibition was a big success with reflective thoughts of how much more you learn if it's made fun.
