                Storyboard</h1>
            <p>
                The storyboard was part of Foodsharing Copenhagen. In order to begin production we must have our storyboard approved. It contains shot by shot of the video. It's a simple tool to speed up production and helped us greatly.

            <p>
                Having the storyboard means no discussion of what or how to shoot the video. It also helped envision the video and better prepare for shooting, have already prepared nessecary props etc.

            <h2>What i've learned</h2>
            <p>
                Creating a storyboard helped with the idea generation. We all sat together and shared thoughts of how we wanted the outcome to be. It prepares one for a sped up prodction when taking into account the different video elements we have to work with. Elements we used such as close ups, long shots, angles, smooth out etc.
                <br> All these were new to me but it makes a difference with the outcome of the video as it was much more exciting when needed to and calm when called for.
